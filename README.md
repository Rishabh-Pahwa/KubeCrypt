# 🔐 KubeCrypt

**KubeCrypt** simplifies the creation of [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) for Kubernetes using `kubeseal`. Easily generate both **Opaque** and **TLS** sealed secrets through a secure, browser-based UI — all without compromising your private key.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Secure & Private**: Your `.pem` certificate file is **never uploaded or stored**. All encryption is handled locally in your browser.
- 🧩 **Sealed Secret Generation**: Supports both `Opaque` and `TLS` secret types.
- 🧰 **Base64 Decoder Utility** *(Optional)*: Decode base64-encoded strings quickly when working with Kubernetes secrets.
- 🐳 **Run Locally with Docker**: Use the provided Dockerfile to run KubeCrypt privately in your own environment.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Upload your **Sealed Secrets public key** (`.pem` file).
2. Choose the secret type: **Opaque** or **TLS**.
3. Enter your secret data (key-value pairs).
4. Click **Generate Sealed Secret** — your output is ready!
5. *(Optional)* Use the built-in base64 decoder for quick lookups.

> ✅ Everything is handled **client-side**. Your `.pem` never leaves your device.

### 🔐 Security Note

KubeCrypt is designed with privacy and security in mind:
  + The .pem public key is only used in-browser for encryption.
  + No files or secret data are ever uploaded or stored on the server.
  + You retain full control over your encryption materials.
  
For maximum security, you can self-host KubeCrypt using the Docker method above.
